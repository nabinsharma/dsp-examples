This repo consists of Python implementation of the numerical
examples in the the Coursera offering of Digital Signal Processing 
by Paolo Prandoni and Martin Vetterli.


Although I re-coded (Matlab code is available in course website) the
examples in Python, all the intellectual property and copyrights belong
to Paolo and Martin.
