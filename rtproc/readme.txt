Digital Signal Processing (Coursera/EPFL)
by Paolo Prandoni, Martin Vetterli

Real-time audio processing in C++

Original source code (provided in the course website
https://class.coursera.org/dsp-002/wiki/view?page=RTproc):
https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/dsp/num_examples/rtproc.zip


The original source had conio.h as shell input/output utility.
The related functionalities have been fulfilled by ncurses.h
(it has been assumed ncurses is part of system libraries).

From rtproc folder, run makefile to get rtproc binary.

So far, I have not beena able to listen anything other than
REALLY unpleasant clicks.
